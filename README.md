#### Description:
    I knew that I wanted to make a finance-related app for my final project, as I am interested in the world of quantitative finance. I debated between a couple of options, including a bond yield pricer, but I decided on an option pricer as I believed it would be more attainable using my current skills. I did some research on the different ways to price an option, and I decided to use the Black-Scholes model, as it seemed relatively straightforward and it is the most prominent system.
